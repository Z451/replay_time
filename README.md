# Environment
The analyses were run using **Python 3.10.18**.  
All package versions are listed in `requirements.txt`.  
To replicate the environment:

# Data
- Example preprocessed data sufficient to reproduce the figure-level results are included in the `data/` folder.  
- Large files (e.g., `.7z`) are tracked using **Git LFS**
- Complete preprocessing dataset available upon request.
- Full analysis code available after publication.
